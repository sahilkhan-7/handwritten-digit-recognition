# üñãÔ∏è Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN
This project showcases a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. With an accuracy of over 99.2%, this model can identify digits (0-9) from grayscale images and provides real-time predictions using an interactive interface powered by Gradio.

## üìñ About the Project

This project was developed as part of my internship at **Zidio Development**. The aim was to build a neural network model that recognizes handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** with over 97.5% accuracy. A Gradio interface was implemented to allow users to interact with the model by drawing digits on a canvas and receiving real-time predictions.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11.8**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** for building and training the deep learning model
- **OpenCV** for image preprocessing
- **Gradio (v2.3.5)** for creating the user interface
- **NumPy** for handling arrays
- **Pandas** for data manipulation

## üß† Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of three convolutional layers followed by a dense layer and an output layer with softmax activation. Below is a detailed breakdown:

- **Input Layer:** Accepts 28x28 grayscale images with one channel.
- **Conv2D Layer 1:** 32 filters, (3x3) kernel size, ReLU activation, MaxPooling.
- **Conv2D Layer 2:** 64 filters, (3x3) kernel size, ReLU activation, MaxPooling.
- **Conv2D Layer 3:** 64 filters, (3x3) kernel size, ReLU activation.
- **Fully Connected Dense Layer:** 64 units, ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer:** 10 units, softmax activation for digit classification.

The model was compiled using **categorical cross-entropy** loss and the **Adam optimizer**, achieving a training accuracy of over 99.2%.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Once the app is running, you'll be able to:

- Draw a digit (0-9) using the sketchpad in the Gradio interface.
Click "Submit" to see the predicted digit displayed.


## üìä Results

The model achieved an impressive **99.2% accuracy** on the MNIST test dataset. Below are some sample results from the model:
